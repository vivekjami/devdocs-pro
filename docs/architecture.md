# DevDocs Pro Architecture

## Overview

DevDocs Pro is a real-time API documentation system that generates accurate documentation from actual HTTP traffic. The system is built with Rust for performance and reliability, featuring a multi-crate architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.

## Core Principles

### Data Integrity First
- Every HTTP transaction is cryptographically hashed for tamper detection
- Immutable storage prevents modification of captured data
- Regular integrity verification ensures data consistency
- Atomic operations guarantee transactional consistency

### Security by Design
- Automatic PII detection and filtering using configurable patterns
- Sensitive header and parameter redaction
- Configurable data retention policies
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data

### Performance & Scalability
- Sub-millisecond request interception overhead
- Streaming body capture with memory-mapped files for large payloads
- Intelligent sampling strategies to control resource usage
- Asynchronous processing pipeline keeps impact minimal

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Library (`devdocs-core`)

The foundation of the system providing:

- **Data Models**: Strongly-typed HTTP transaction representations
- **Storage Layer**: Pluggable storage backends (memory, disk, database)
- **Schema Inference**: Automatic API schema generation from traffic
- **Analysis Engine**: Traffic pattern recognition and statistics

Key features:
- Immutable transaction storage with integrity verification
- Configurable retention policies and cleanup
- Efficient filtering and querying capabilities
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. Middleware (`devdocs-middleware`)

HTTP traffic interception and processing:

- **Tower Integration**: Framework-agnostic middleware using Tower
- **Sampling Strategies**: Multiple algorithms for traffic control
- **Security Filters**: PII detection and sensitive data protection
- **Request/Response Correlation**: Tracks complete HTTP transactions

Key features:
- Configurable size limits and content-type filtering
- Path-based exclusion rules
- Intelligent sampling (percentage, rate-limited, endpoint-specific)
- Real-time integrity validation

### 3. Language Bindings (`devdocs-bindings`)

Framework-specific integrations:

- **Python**: FastAPI, Django, Flask support
- **Node.js**: Express, Koa, NestJS support
- **Go**: Gin, Echo, Chi, net/http support
- **Common Interface**: Unified configuration and behavior

Key features:
- Framework-specific optimizations
- Consistent configuration across languages
- Automatic framework detection
- Zero-configuration setup for common patterns

## Data Flow

```
1. HTTP Request → Middleware Interceptor
2. Request Analysis → Sampling Decision
3. Body Capture → PII Filtering
4. Response Capture → Transaction Creation
5. Integrity Hashing → Storage
6. Schema Inference → Documentation Update
```
